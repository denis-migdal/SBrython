## Currently Working on...

- Editor
    - [ ] DOC !!!
        - [ ] Presentation/goal
- I want the transpiler to be as simple as possible for educational purposes (I want to put student projects on it, so that they can play with it).
- I want the generated JS to be as simple as possible to read for educational purposes (I want students to be able to read it).
- I will not implement all Python features, only some basic ones.
- I don't care to be fully CPython compliant.
- I don't care to be able to support Python libraries.
- I don't care about performances.
- I only care about stability.
- I will publish some PoC, for AST tree structure, AST tree printing, unit tests, documentations, etc. that I hope could be interesting and potentially adapted for Brython.
- I think some design choices I'll make could be interesting for Brython, so it could serve as a PoC on the way some features can be implemented/architectured.
